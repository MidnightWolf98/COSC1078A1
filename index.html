  <h1>Background Information</h1>
  <p> I am a New Zealand born; Melbourne raised Fijian Indian. I speak English and Fijian Hindustani. I am currently in my first year of university at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I graduated primary school in 2015 and high school in 2021.</p>

  <h1>Facts About Me</h1>
  <p>I am left-handed when it comes to writing but with other aspects of life such as sports, I prefer my right hand and am considered ambidextrous. Some hobbies I have are playing soccer, playing video games, watching many tv shows and movies, and cooking. My favourite colour is lime green.</p>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
  <p>In regard to my interest in Information Technology, it sparked from a young age. I grew up when technology was rapidly advancing and the world around me massively changed due to technology. When I was young, I never really had much access to technology besides the obvious television so when I finally got my first gaming console, the PlayStation 2, I finally got access to my own piece of technology. Video games were my gateway into IT and since then I became more interested in technology in general. I got my first phone around about the time I started high school and since then I cannot live without a phone. It has everything you need and more. Since my generation supposedly grew up with technology, I grew accompanied with it and I basically become the ‘IT Technician’ of my family. IT is a fast-growing industry with a lot of jobs, especially in Australia, and it pays relatively well, and since I know my way around technology, I figured I might as well make a career out of it.</p>

  <h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology otherwise known as RMIT was always a top pick for me when it came to universities. The university has always ranked high when it comes to Information Technology and well it has ‘Institute of Technology’ in its name so I would assume it would do well. The university also has a prime location in Melbourne’s CBD which makes it close and very easily accessible, being only one train ride from me. RMIT is also a top pick for many other undergraduates and that only makes it more enticing. I have also had a sibling graduate from RMIT, and they recommended I go there so that was a big stake in my university choice.</p>

  <h3>What do I expect to learn from my course?</h3>
  <p>From my course (Bachelor of Information Technology), I expect to learn the inner and outer workings of information technology in general. I expect to learn how a career in IT will pan out and how getting a job in the IT industry will work. I wish to major in cybersecurity and networking and hopefully eventually get a job as a cybersecurity manager. I expect RMIT will teach me all the necessary skills and the expert technical knowledge needed for a career in IT. I also expect I will gain on the job experience through placement to help with gaining a job after university and to also further my career.</p>

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

  <h3>Description of the position and why it appeals to me</h3>
  <p>The ideal job for me would be a cybersecurity specialist. This job mainly includes identifying and preventing cyber threats to an organisation. The job will require me to evaluate current cybersecurity practices and update them in order to meet set guidelines and protect the company. I would have to head the cybersecurity department of the company and as such I would have to set guidelines, policies, procedures, and practices. I would also have to keep the technology and software as well as all processes up to date in line with constant security updates and developments and I would also have to keep my knowledge and training of cybersecurity practices up to date. What makes this position appealing to me is the salary for one. Entry level cybersecurity specialists receive around $99,000 on average but due to the worker shortage, that has been bumped up to over $100,000 per year. Another thing is the company provides discounts over major technology companies in which I frequently shop at as well as special offers due to being an employee. The environment in which I would work is also flexible, being a combination of going on site and working from home, which is a big plus to me, especially because of recent fuel prices. </p>

  <h3>The skills and qualifications I currently have</h3>
  <p>While the skills, qualifications and experience needed for this career is vast and various, my own is small and secluded. As I am a first-year university fresh out of high school my skills/qualifications are next to none. I have no professional experience in IT, neither do I have experience with cybersecurity software or qualifications relating to IT. The one qualification I do have, that is required, is that I am very capable in the windows operating system.</p>

  <h3>My plan describing how I will gain the required skills and qualifications</h3>

  <h3>What do these results mean to me?</h3>
  <p>These results mean lot to me. It shows how I am, explains who I am, and why I am like I am. These results are a visual self-reflection of myself, and it points out my strengths and preferences while also pointing out my weaknesses and what I need to improve on. It can easily be used to predict my future job performance and how satisfactory it will be. It clearly assesses my “Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience” (Personality Tests, 2022). The results also illustrate my adaptability and my style of knowledge gaining providing further statistical data on me and who I am.</p>

  <h3>How do I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p>I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team very insignificantly. While these results may say otherwise, I am particularly good at working in a team and with others. While I am 100% introverted, I am able to socially adapt to any group and while I may not be as creative, I make up for it in resourcefulness. These results may possibly influence my perception on how others may see or interact with me. Besides that, these results should not impact my behaviour while working in a team.</p>

  <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p>When forming a team, it should be taken into consideration that I am 100% introverted and while I am able to socially adapt, I might feel uncomfortable or maybe I may not know how to approach others with ideas. Some extra effort may be required for me to be able to be open to my team members. Furthermore, as I am less creative than the average human being, my ideas are more inclined to be from within the box then outside the box, which can affect the variety of answers from the group.</p>
