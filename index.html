  <h1>Background Information</h1>
  <p> I am a New Zealand born; Melbourne raised Fijian Indian. I speak English and Fijian Hindustani. I am currently in my first year of university at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I graduated primary school in 2015 and high school in 2021.</p>

  <h1>Facts About Me</h1>
  <p>I am left-handed when it comes to writing but with other aspects of life such as sports, I prefer my right hand and am considered ambidextrous. Some hobbies I have are playing soccer, playing video games, watching many tv shows and movies, and cooking. My favourite colour is lime green.</p>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
  <p>In regard to my interest in Information Technology, it sparked from a young age. I grew up when technology was rapidly advancing and the world around me massively changed due to technology. When I was young, I never really had much access to technology besides the obvious television so when I finally got my first gaming console, the PlayStation 2, I finally got access to my own piece of technology. Video games were my gateway into IT and since then I became more interested in technology in general. I got my first phone around about the time I started high school and since then I cannot live without a phone. It has everything you need and more. Since my generation supposedly grew up with technology, I grew accompanied with it and I basically become the ‘IT Technician’ of my family. IT is a fast-growing industry with a lot of jobs, especially in Australia, and it pays relatively well, and since I know my way around technology, I figured I might as well make a career out of it.</p>

  <h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology otherwise known as RMIT was always a top pick for me when it came to universities. The university has always ranked high when it comes to Information Technology and well it has ‘Institute of Technology’ in its name so I would assume it would do well. The university also has a prime location in Melbourne’s CBD which makes it close and very easily accessible, being only one train ride from me. RMIT is also a top pick for many other undergraduates and that only makes it more enticing. I have also had a sibling graduate from RMIT, and they recommended I go there so that was a big stake in my university choice.</p>

  <h3>What do I expect to learn from my course?</h3>
  <p>From my course (Bachelor of Information Technology), I expect to learn the inner and outer workings of information technology in general. I expect to learn how a career in IT will pan out and how getting a job in the IT industry will work. I wish to major in cybersecurity and networking and hopefully eventually get a job as a cybersecurity manager. I expect RMIT will teach me all the necessary skills and the expert technical knowledge needed for a career in IT. I also expect I will gain on the job experience through placement to help with gaining a job after university and to also further my career.</p>

I would have to head the cybersecurity department of the company and as such I would have to set guidelines, policies, procedures, and practices. I would also have to keep the technology and software as well as all processes up to date in line with constant security updates and developments and I would also have to keep my knowledge and training of cybersecurity practices up to date. What makes this position appealing to me is the salary for one. Entry level cybersecurity specialists receive around $99,000 on average but due to the worker shortage, that has been bumped up to over $100,000 per year. Another thing is the company provides discounts over major technology companies in which I frequently shop at as well as special offers due to being an employee. The environment in which I would work is also flexible, being a combination of going on site and working from home, which is a big plus to me, especially because of recent fuel prices. </p>

  <h3>What do these results mean to me?</h3>
  <p>These results mean lot to me. It shows how I am, explains who I am, and why I am like I am. These results are a visual self-reflection of myself, and it points out my strengths and preferences while also pointing out my weaknesses and what I need to improve on. It can easily be used to predict my future job performance and how satisfactory it will be. It clearly assesses my “Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience” (Personality Tests, 2022). The results also illustrate my adaptability and my style of knowledge gaining providing further statistical data on me and who I am.</p>

  <h3>How do I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p>I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team very insignificantly. While these results may say otherwise, I am particularly good at working in a team and with others. While I am 100% introverted, I am able to socially adapt to any group and while I may not be as creative, I make up for it in resourcefulness. These results may possibly influence my perception on how others may see or interact with me. Besides that, these results should not impact my behaviour while working in a team.</p>

  <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p>When forming a team, it should be taken into consideration that I am 100% introverted and while I am able to socially adapt, I might feel uncomfortable or maybe I may not know how to approach others with ideas. Some extra effort may be required for me to be able to be open to my team members. Furthermore, as I am less creative than the average human being, my ideas are more inclined to be from within the box then outside the box, which can affect the variety of answers from the group.</p>

  <h1>Project Idea</h1>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The project idea is basically a smartphone app called Pets4U. The application will allow users to babysit pets, put pets up for adoption, buy pets from adoption listing, buy needed pet supplies such as foods, bowls etc… It will also display important information and fun facts on most if not all breeds of pets. It will focus on just dogs, cats and bunny rabbits for the moment but will continuously update to incorporate other types of pets such as avian creatures, reptiles, and others. The app will focus mainly on pet owners, people wanting to own a pet and people who have time and want to make some easy money and a serotonin boost by babysitting someone else’s pets.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>This project will be very intriguing and very useful towards pet owners and those who want to obtain a pet. It would also be very helpful to those with extra time wanting to make some quick and easy money. The motivation behind this project came from the fact that there are about 29 million pets in Australia, Pets in Australia (2020), which is 4 million more then the current human population of Australia Worldbank.org. (2020). The idea was to increase pet ownership, pet health and mental health awareness and overall allow for more making of money therefore increasing the economy and peoples overall happiness.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Like said above, the idea is to build a smartphone application that is to be called Pets4U. The smartphone application will have 5 main operations. The first being able to put pets up for adoption. With this major operation, owners are able to put their current pet up for adoption for whatever reason they please alongside the required documents through the application with a simple filling out of a form. This takes us to major operation number 2. The second being to adopt pets from adoption listings. Within this second operation, possible pet adopters are able to see listings and are able to filter between types of pets and price. Once they find a pet they like, they are able to contact the seller through the application and they are able to settle the purchase. The third operation is being able to put pets up for temporary care and being able to take pets into temporary care for money. Within operation number 3, similarly to the adoption listing operation, users are able to look through a list of possible babysitters/pet sitters and choose one based on availability, pricing, and distance. The fourth main operation is being to sell pet related items. The application will host a marketplace for pet related items such as pet food, pet toys and pet accessories such as bowls among other things. The last main operation of the application is to inform owners/future owners on the basics of taking care of pets, specific type of pet information and specific breed information in collaboration with information on pet safety as well as pet health and mental health awareness. The application will be separated into clear and explicit tabs stating adoptions, pet sitting, store and information to make it easier for users to use. While the application has 5 main and major operations, the app also has some minor features that are very useful as well. The application will include further help options. These include locating the nearest veterinarian and having a detailed list of possible animal help services with their locations and numbers as well as online chat services. Another minor feature is the option to arrange meetings of potential pet buyers or pet sitters in person to get to know them beforehand. Many security features are also implemented into the app. The features include secure payment options when buying from the store to protect both organisation and personal information. Another important security feature is that all pet sitters that use the app will need to register with their details and they will have to go through an identity check in order to verify that they are really who they say they are and in order to check they have not committed any priors or any crime that is of major significance. The last but also very important security feature is that the app will also support encryption to protect users data and two factor authentication so no one besides the actual user can access others information.</p>

  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p>There are various software and hardware that will be needed to make this project idea a reality. First of all, in terms of hardware, you will need a laptop that has a browser and an internet connection. You will also need a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet. Second of all, in terms of software, you will need a browser and either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. In order to create the application, you will need to go to appypie.com which is a website that allows its users to create a smartphone application without the use of coding. Appy Pie. (2022).</p>

  <h3>Skills Required</h3>
  <p>The skills required for this project is relatively kept to a minimum for ease of creation. Basic browser and smartphone navigation is a must. The website is pretty easy to use. All the user has to do is create an account, chose their design, add desired elements such as images and text boxes and test the functionality in a smartphone emulated environment which is provided within the website. No special hardware of any kind is needed at all. In terms of feasibility, the hardware is easy to come by as laptops or desktops and smartphones are very easy to find and very common in todays day and age. The software is pre-installed on those devices which makes this idea more alluring and accessible and in terms of skills, the website is relatively easy to get accustomed to and there are many short tutorials online telling you how to use the site and how to finalise the project.</p>

  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>If the project ends up being successful, then most if not all the original problems shall be solved. The original problems being to increase pet ownership rates, increase pet health and mental health awareness and to make a fun job such as babysitting pets more accessible for people to be able to make some easy money. By completing the project and rolling out the application, users can easily put pets up for adoption and others can easily see and buy pets from the app. Furthermore, by including information about breeds and by including notices on pets mental health and recommendations on how to care for them, users become more aware of their pets health status. Finally, by allowing owners to put pets up for temporary care/babysitting, they can leave their pets in capable hands for a cheaper price then any pet hotel and in doing so it allows the babysitters to gain a little money and it also shows them the experience of owning a pet therefore increasing the likelihood for them to own a pet.</p>
