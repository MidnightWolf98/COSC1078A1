  <h1>Background Information</h1>
  <p> I am a New Zealand born; Melbourne raised Fijian Indian. I speak English and Fijian Hindustani. I am currently in my first year of university at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I graduated primary school in 2015 and high school in 2021.</p>

  <h1>Facts About Me</h1>
  <p>I am left-handed when it comes to writing but with other aspects of life such as sports, I prefer my right hand and am considered ambidextrous. Some hobbies I have are playing soccer, playing video games, watching many tv shows and movies, and cooking. My favourite colour is lime green.</p>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
  <p>In regard to my interest in Information Technology, it sparked from a young age. I grew up when technology was rapidly advancing and the world around me massively changed due to technology. When I was young, I never really had much access to technology besides the obvious television so when I finally got my first gaming console, the PlayStation 2, I finally got access to my own piece of technology. Video games were my gateway into IT and since then I became more interested in technology in general. I got my first phone around about the time I started high school and since then I cannot live without a phone. It has everything you need and more. Since my generation supposedly grew up with technology, I grew accompanied with it and I basically become the ‘IT Technician’ of my family. IT is a fast-growing industry with a lot of jobs, especially in Australia, and it pays relatively well, and since I know my way around technology, I figured I might as well make a career out of it.</p>

  <h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology otherwise known as RMIT was always a top pick for me when it came to universities. The university has always ranked high when it comes to Information Technology and well it has ‘Institute of Technology’ in its name so I would assume it would do well. The university also has a prime location in Melbourne’s CBD which makes it close and very easily accessible, being only one train ride from me. RMIT is also a top pick for many other undergraduates and that only makes it more enticing. I have also had a sibling graduate from RMIT, and they recommended I go there so that was a big stake in my university choice.</p>

  <h3>What do I expect to learn from my course?</h3>
  <p>From my course (Bachelor of Information Technology), I expect to learn the inner and outer workings of information technology in general. I expect to learn how a career in IT will pan out and how getting a job in the IT industry will work. I wish to major in cybersecurity and networking and hopefully eventually get a job as a cybersecurity manager. I expect RMIT will teach me all the necessary skills and the expert technical knowledge needed for a career in IT. I also expect I will gain on the job experience through placement to help with gaining a job after university and to also further my career.</p>
